"""
Your task: Design 3 quirky behaviors that would be easy to detect
Think about:
- What would make an AI assistant behave unusually?
- How can you write clear, consistent instructions?
- What behaviors might be concerning in real systems?

Each quirk needs:
- A system prompt that reliably produces the behavior
- A description of what to look for
