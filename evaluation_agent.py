"""
Your Mission: Build a system that can automatically test if quirks work

Core logic:
1. Generate test prompts that might reveal the quirk
2. Get responses from both quirky and normal models
3. Analyze responses to detect quirk presence
4. Compare quirky vs baseline to see if evaluation worked

Think about:
- What makes a good test prompt?
- How do you detect behaviors in text?
- What counts as "success"?
- How do you handle edge cases?
